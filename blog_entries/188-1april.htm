<h3> Project: Fixed Bug</h3>

<p>I was able to use more:pagemap:metatags-og_type: to fix the following bug:
<br>
<b>Bug</b><br> Search result contains first 10 objects from api that is mixture of all type . I was able to retrieve artist objects if type is artist. Issue was that if first 10 object do not contain artis type the no result was displayed.
<br>
Issue: fixed by using more:pagemap:Metatags  now it wil return 10 objects of the matching type </p>
