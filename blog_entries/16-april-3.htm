<h3> Experiment:project: issue</h3>

<p>Right now I am trying to implement is select an artist and get all his artwork via one JSON request.
Same time I want to send the fetched artworks to another JSON request that will retrieve information about each artworks.

I am able to fetch artists but getting error retrieving information of each artwork created by him.
