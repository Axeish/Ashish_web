<h3> Project : Artist Page</h3>

<p>I am still stuck at Artist search API. The functionality works but I am trying to hide my key from the source file but I am not abke to.
The issue is I have two keys which I have to use as combination . One is secret key and another is password key. 
I am able to get authentication but now i am able to get only one json request as successful and next json request is calling for authentication error failure.
I will for now skip it and undo the changes.
will work on it again after my PDP submission that is due on Monday.
