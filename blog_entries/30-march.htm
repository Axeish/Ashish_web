<h3> Project : Art Gallery </h3>
<p><b>artsy.net
   </b></p>

<p> Professor suggested me to go through artsy.net and it had wonderful art collection that I can use. I will definitely be using artsy.<br>
So far I have decided following <p>
<h5>Primary Goal</h5>
<ul>
<li> Display art-works on homepage as a slideshow.
</li>
<li>Allow browsers to select categories for artworks they want to see and display them.
</li>
<li> Have information like Artist, description and year of paintings for each when a single art is displayed.
</li>
<li> Use CSS highly to beautify the website .
</li>
<li> Implement Responsive page 
</li>
</ul>
