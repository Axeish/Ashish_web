        Madhubani painting or Mithila painting is a style of Indian painting, practiced in the Mithila region of Bihar state, India, and the adjoining parts of Terai in Nepal. Painting is done with fingers, twigs, brushes, nib-pens, and matchsticks, using natural dyes and pigments, and is characterized by eye-catching geometrical patterns.[1] There are paintings for each occasion and festival such as birth, marriage, Holi, Surya Shasti, kali puja, Upanayanam, Durga Puja etc.
The Mithila region, from which the name Mithila art is derived, is believed to have been the kingdom of King Janak. The exact location of it lies in present day Janakpur of Nepal.

    <p>My most of the art works are based on Madhubani style. I have a dedicated set of artworks with the series name "Mehfil" The style and patern is influenced from Mithla art work but 
        mode of art is Digital . One can refer it as a  modern Mithla art.
