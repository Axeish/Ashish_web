                adjoining parts of Terai in Nepal. Painting is done with fingers, twigs, brushes, nib-pens, and matchsticks, using natural dyes and pigments, 
                and is characterized by eye-catching geometrical patterns.[1] There are paintings for each occasion and festival such as birth, marriage, 
                Holi, Surya Shasti, kali puja, Upanayanam, Durga Puja etc.The Mithila region, from which the name Mithila art is derived, is believed 
                to have been the kingdom of King Janak. The exact location of it lies in present day Janakpur of Nepal.

                Phad painting or Phad is a style religious scroll painting and folk painting, practiced in Rajasthan state of 
                India.This style of painting is traditionally done on a long piece of cloth or canvas, known as phad. The narratives of the folk
                 deities of Rajasthan, mostly of Pabuji and Devnarayan are depicted on the phads. The Bhopas, the priest-singers traditionally carry 
                the painted phads along with them and use these as the mobile temples of the folk deities. The phads of Pabuji are normally about 15 
                feet in length, while the phads of Devnarayan are normally about 30 feet long. Traditionally the phads are painted with vegetable colors.
